# SQL_GRU

This is the final repository for a SQL sequence generation with GRU. The original repository "SQL_Generator" is the working directory and will be removed once I clean up the codes.

This model attempts to generate random SQL sequnce with SENLIDB Dataset. 

Result:
Single Direction 2 layers GRU generate sequence fine, but Bi-dircetional does not work. I am not sure about why yet.
